    <p> This project follows the <b>Martini glass </b> approach to tell the story of how <b>quality of life </b>in countries vary based on various other parameters. <br>

  <h3>Project  Description</h3>
  <p> <font  color="brown">Q) What determines the <b>quality of life </b>, and which country has the best quality of life? <br> </font>
    <font face="black" color="black" size="3"> 
   <br> <i><b>Safety </b>should be one of the top parameters for a country's quality of life to be ranked higher - does the data support this assumption? </i>
    <br> <br> <b>What about the purchasing power? </b> <br>
    Does purchasing power go up or down when the quality of life improves? Or is there no direct co-relation between those two variables?

    <br> <br> <b>and finally, what about the cost of the living? </b>
    <br>
    Are all the countries with the highest quality of living default to a higher cost of living? (** <i> <font face="gray" color="gray" >Since opportunities usually come at a price?). </font></i> What if we had countries with the higher quality of life and still has a low cost of living? Would that be the most ideal scenario?

    <br> <br> To answer these questions and more, we have followed a <b> <i><font  color="blue" size="2"> Martini structure </font> </i></b>to give just enough information for viewer to be interested in exploring on their own .<font face="black" color="black" size="3"> 
    <a href="Viz.html"><font face="Blue" color="blue" > here </font></a></p>
</div>

<div id="Scenes" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Scenes</h3>
  <p> There are multiple scenes for the reader to navigate:
   <br> 
     &emsp;  &emsp;  ---> <b> Quality of Life </b><i>vs </i><b> Cost of Living <br>
      &emsp;  &emsp; --->  Quality of Life </b><i>vs </i><b> Safety Index <br>
      &emsp;  &emsp; --->  Quality of Life </b><i>vs </i><b> Purchasing Power.<br> </b>
      <br>

<i> <font face="gray" color="gray" > **For brevity, I will henceforth use the short form <b>"QoL" </b> to indicate <b> "Quality of Life"</b></i> </font>
<br><br>

The first scene is the visual representation of  <b>QoL vs Cost of Living </b> - the scatterplot pinpoints the data per country and also gives an overall trend. 
<br><br>

There is clearly an <b> upward trend </b>: The Cost of living increases as the Quality of life improves in a country - this is in line with the very first conclusion in the Project Description section.

How about the other two sections? Well, I don't want to give out spoilers - so please check those out <a href="Viz.html"><font face="Blue" color="blue" > here </font></a></p>

<br><br><font face="brown" color="brown" size="4"> 
Within all the <b>scenes</b>, we are using the following to ensure <mark>visual consistency </mark>amongst those scenes:<br><br></font>
<font face="black" color="black" size="3"> 
   a) All the scenes make use of the same scatterplot so that reader could focus on the core message rather than encountering a new chart type in every scene. This is done to keep the viewer oriented through the transactions and state changes.<br>
   b) All the scenes use the same theme -   #B5C689 or ”Darkest Kelly”. (This background color was specifically chosen to be pleasing to the eye and not distract the viewer from the content) <br>
   c) All the scenes make use of same color template as well as the shape/size of the legends <br>
   d) Navigation between scenes is similar and easy to view --> hyperlinks are repeated where applicable for easy access as well as to illustrate the specific point.<br>

<div id="Annotation" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Annotations</h3>
  <p> To represent the annotations within the scene, we can hover over the circle in the graph and see the exact country info along with the QoL index data. <br>

   <br> The annotations are <b> cleared </b> within a scene when the cursor is moved away from the corresponding circle. Also, the annotations are cleared between scenes because we are using different parameters for displaying the scatterplot charts.<br><br>




 </p> 
</div>

<div id="Parameters" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Parameters</h3>
  <p>
    Parameters are the variables used for narration - here the three variables are:
    <br>
      <ol> <b>Cost of Living, <br>
            Safety Index </b>& <b><br>
            Purchasing Power.</b> <br> <br>

    The  three buttons at the top introduce the three parameters for this visualization, namely "Qol vs Cost of Living", "Qol vs Safety Index" and "Qol vs Purchasing Power" <br>

    Clicking on the buttons incorporates these parameters and triggers a change in the scenes. Please make note of the change in Y axis label and value - when button is clicked 

  Thus clicking on these parameters controls the state of the visualization and gives the event state .</p>
</div>

<div id="Triggers" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Triggers</h3>
  <p>Triggers are the actions that occur as a result of various interactions.
      <br>
      Here, there are numerous triggers which enable us to navigate between the home page and the visualization page as well as to the numerous sections within both of these pages. <br>

      <br>

     <b> The triggers are listed below: </b><br><br>

      1) On the <font color = brown> home page</font>, we have the menu on the left <b> <mark><-- </b></mark> with various sections such as 'Project Description' , 'Scenes', 'Annotations', 'Parameters', and 'Triggers'.
      <br>
      Clicking on any of these sections <mark> triggers </mark> a change in the display. 
      <br> Thus all of these are triggers on the home page.

      <br> <br>

      2) The <font color = brown> link </font> at the top titled "Skip this, take me to the actual Visualization" triggers another change in the page itself - this takes us to the visualization section.
      <br><br>

      3)<font color = brown> Within the visualization section</font>, the three buttons at the top for "Qol vs Cost of Living", "Qol vs Safety Index" and "Qol vs Purchasing Power"  are the three triggers which cause an action change and the corresponding scatterplot chart is displayed.

       <br><br>

      <b> <mark> NOTE: </mark></b> The user is made aware of the triggers by the use of interactive and prominent hyperlinks and buttons.
